# 3D-Packing-Visualizer

This project is a 3D Container Packing Visualization Tool that helps users optimize and visualize how rectangular items can be arranged within a container, considering various spacing and arrangement constraints.
Key Features:

Item Configuration

Users can specify the dimensions (width, depth, height) of individual items in millimeters
Define arrangement patterns (rows, columns, layers)
Set container and item gaps for spacing optimization


Gap Management

Container Gaps: Define spacing between the items and container walls
Item Gaps: Control spacing between individual items


3D Visualization

Interactive 3D rendering using Three.js
Real-time updates as configurations change
Color-coded containers with transparent walls and wireframe outlines
Dimension lines and measurements displayed on the model


User Interface

Simple form inputs for all configurations
Unit toggle between millimeters (mm) and centimeters (cm)
Center view button for optimal viewing angle
Download options for both images and 3D scenes


Technical Specifications

Built with Three.js for 3D rendering
Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
Modular JavaScript architecture with separate classes for:

PackingCalculator: Handles dimensional calculations
PackingVisualizer: Manages 3D visualization
PackingApp: Coordinates UI and business logic





Primary Goals:

Help users optimize space utilization in container packing
Provide clear visual feedback for packing arrangements
Offer flexible configuration options for different packing needs
Enable easy sharing and documentation through export features

Use Cases:

Logistics and warehouse planning
Shipping container optimization
Storage space planning
Manufacturing layout optimization
Educational tool for spatial arrangement concepts

The tool prioritizes user experience while providing powerful visualization capabilities for practical packing scenarios.
